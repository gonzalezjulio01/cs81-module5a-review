# Reflection – Hobby Tracker Review

## What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?

I learned how higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` are actually used in real code. I had used them before in practice, but seeing them in a working example made it easier to understand. It helped me realize how each one has a specific job — like `filter()` to pick certain data, and `reduce()` to total things up.

## What was the most confusing part?

At first, the `reduce()` function in `totalTime()` was a little tricky. It took me a moment to understand how it keeps a running total through the array. Once I looked at it closely and thought of it like a loop, it made more sense. The rest of the functions were pretty clear.
